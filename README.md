This repository showcases three exciting projects created as part of my learning journey and coding practice with CodeAlpha. Each project highlights a unique aspect of programming in C++ and Qt, from game development to file handling and interactive GUI design. Here's an overview of the three projects:

##üéÆ Number Guessing Game
The Number Guessing Game is a fun and interactive console-based game built using C++. In this game, the computer selects a random number, and the user tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts. The game provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guessed number is too high or too low, helping the player zero in on the correct answer. This project was a great exercise in implementing random number generation, control structures, and user interaction within a simple but engaging program.

##üìÅ File Management System
The File Management System is a command-line application that demonstrates practical file handling in C++. This system allows users to create, read, update, and delete files, providing a hands-on way to manage data efficiently. It features:

Reading and writing content to files.
Modifying existing file content.
Deleting files safely.
This project helped me dive deeper into C++ file I/O streams (ifstream, ofstream, and fstream) and reinforced my understanding of file operations in real-world applications.

##üß© Sudoku Puzzle
The Sudoku Puzzle project is an interactive graphical application developed using Qt Creator and C++. It offers a complete Sudoku-solving experience with the following features:

A 9x9 grid where users can input numbers.
Preloaded Sudoku puzzles with certain cells set as read-only.
Validation to detect and highlight duplicate numbers in rows, columns, and subgrids.
A reset option to start fresh at any time.
This project provided me with hands-on experience in GUI development, input validation, and creating dynamic and user-friendly interfaces using the Qt framework.

#üí° Learning Outcomes
Through these projects, I have:

Strengthened my understanding of C++ fundamentals, including file handling, randomization, and algorithms.
Gained valuable experience in GUI development with Qt.
Improved problem-solving skills by implementing real-world scenarios in code.
Enhanced my ability to debug and optimize applications for better user experiences.
